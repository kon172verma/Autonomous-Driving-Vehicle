Since the datasets are huge and can not be uploaded on Github, there are folders created for the same on google drive. 

The links for datasets are as follows:
 * Raw Dataset : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17LSETFVS1UpORog0AT2R7bDdGnLzV8_M?usp=sharing
 * Processed Dataset : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1M7GB03XJGAqPAf7dtQEaHLaMG5M-7E-Y?usp=sharing
